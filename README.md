## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I'm a **Cybersecurity Professional** currently fine-tuning my skills and geeking out over all things cyber defense. With a **Diploma and Certificate IV in Cybersecurity**, I've been diving deep into areas like vulnerability assessment, incident response, and data analytics. 

When I'm not safeguarding digital realms, I’m likely writing songs, collecting vinyl, or jamming with my band 🎸.

An IoT environment I built based on a given (fictitious) business scenario! I set up motion sensors, finger print sensors and even a humidity sensor! Was super fun to create and super fun to show! Have a look!

My crack at deploying resources on the cloud for a (fictitious) company known as Argon Solutions! I enjoyed writing powershell scripts for automation of Azure template deployment! The cloud has been conquered!

### [🔗 Project 3: Network Smithin'](https://github.com/HarryB191202/Design_Build_and_Test_Network_Servers/blob/Harry's-Special-Corner/README.md)
Like a skilled armoursmith, in this project I harden and sharpen a network server that I built for a (fictitious) company called PCoint! Take a deep dive as I design, build and test a network server that is stronger and more secure than Mithril!

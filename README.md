## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I'm a **Cybersecurity Professional** currently fine-tuning my skills and geeking out over all things cyber defense. With a **Diploma and Certificate IV in Cybersecurity**, I've been diving deep into areas like vulnerability assessment, incident response, and data analytics. 

When I'm not safeguarding digital realms, I’m likely writing songs, collecting vinyl, or jamming with my band 🎸.
